## Robeats To Eclefsis
The open sourced code for the converter I created that turns Robeats maps created with [Robeats Web Converter](https://spotco.github.io/RobeatsWebConvert2/) to maps for Eclefsis. To run this program, you need a way to run Python files with multiple files. I apologize for this, however I'm unable to create a website for this to be ran on.

Eclefsis is a stupid rhythm game<sup>[1]</sup> I made and designed out of what's essentially spite. Thank you for showing an interest in Eclefsis.

### Extra Notes
<sup>[1]</sup>4-Key exclusively, at the time of writing.
