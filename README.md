## Robeats To Eclefsis
The open sourced code for the converter I created that turns Robeats maps created with [Robeats Web Converter](https://spotco.github.io/RobeatsWebConvert2/) to maps for Eclefsis. You can run this program online using [Eclefsis Note Data Converter](https://replit.com/@eclipsis/notedataconverter).

Eclefsis is a stupid rhythm game I made out of whats essentially spite. Thank you for showing an interest in Eclefsis.
