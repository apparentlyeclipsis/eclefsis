# Open Source Update
Hi, I'm pretty lazy so I'll be open sourcing this and letting the general interested public figure out how to fix/update the chaotic mess that I've created.

Note that this'll only happen **after** the first release of [Eclefsis](https://www.roblox.com/games/110578437513335/Project-Eclefsis). This file will be updated, and will include roblox files containing the primary engine behind Eclefsis.

As of right now, there's no expected release, but I'm very cool and hardworking so there SHOULD be one by the end of summer. No guarantees though.
